Part1. Abstract: We observe and analyze the 2019 CES Phone Survey data. By following graphs and model, we found that people with higher education level have higher satisfaction to Canadian government. This result is important, since we can predict people’s satisfaction to government by their education level, and Canadian education level has always been a concern for citizens and new immigrants.</description>
